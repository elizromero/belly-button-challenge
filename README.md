# belly button challenge

This project involves creating an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs microbes found in human navels. The dashboard visualizes the microbial composition of samples, allowing users to select individual samples and view relevant data through bar and bubble charts, along with demographic metadata.

The dataset highlights that a small number of microbial species (operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) are common among individuals, while most are rare.

## Tools and Libraries
- D3.js: To fetch and parse JSON data from the remote URL.
- Plotly.js: To create interactive bar and bubble charts.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the dashboard.
- JavaScript: For implementing dynamic behavior and data visualization.
